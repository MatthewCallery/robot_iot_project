# robot_iot_project
This repository contains a Robot Operating System (ROS) application which enables PAL Robotics' TIAGo
robot to autonomously build a 2D occupancy grid map of its environment, analyse and segment that map
into its constituent rooms, and communicate the computed building and room dimensions with smart
devices and web services via the IFTTT protocol. 

Installation instructions can be found in the 'Application Installation' document.
